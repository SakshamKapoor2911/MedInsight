## üåü Core Concept

MedLama is a cloud-native, microservices-based platform for preliminary medical diagnostics. It combines:
- A high-performance Go backend for API gateway, message queue, and infrastructure
- A Python AI/ML microservice using LangGraph for advanced medical reasoning with self-hosted LLM inference
- A modern Next.js (React) frontend for a structured, scalable user experience
- **Self-hosted AI inference on GKE using NVIDIA NIM with Gemma 2 for privacy, performance, and cost control**
- External research capabilities via Perplexity API for accessing current medical literature

This architecture enables independent team development, robust scalability, and clear separation of concerns. The system is designed for reliability, extensibility, and real-world healthcare impact while keeping sensitive medical data within our own cloud environment.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Folder Layout

The project is organized as three main microservices, each in its own directory for clear separation of concerns and team independence:

```
Full_stack_Medical_Diagnostics/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend-service/      # Go backend: API gateway, Google Pub/Sub messaging, auth, DB ops
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai-service/           # Python AI/ML: LangGraph agents, LLM integration, research
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ medLama/              # Next.js frontend: UI, components, services, API integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment/               # Docker Compose, Kubernetes manifests, CI/CD (GKE manifests, NIM deployment)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                  # Utility scripts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

**Benefits of this layout:**
- Enables Go, Python, and Frontend teams to work independently and in parallel
- Makes it easy to isolate, debug, and deploy each service separately
- Supports scalable, modular development and clear code ownership
- Simplifies onboarding for new contributors by clarifying service boundaries
- Facilitates containerization and cloud-native deployment on GKE

## üß† Engineering Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Real-time, Multi-turn Conversation State
**Problem:** Maintaining context and accuracy across complex, multi-step medical dialogues.
**Solution:** Use LangGraph to manage robust conversational state and enable tool-using agent workflows.

### Challenge 2: Scalable & Decoupled Microservices
**Problem:** Ensuring the system can handle load and that services can be developed and deployed independently.
**Solution:** A Go-based API gateway communicates with the Python AI service asynchronously via a managed message queue (Google Pub/Sub), creating a resilient and scalable architecture.

### Challenge 3: High-Performance, Private AI Inference
**Problem:** Achieving low-latency responses for a real-time diagnostic tool while ensuring patient data remains private.
**Solution:** Deploy a pre-trained model as an NVIDIA NIM on a GPU-enabled GKE cluster. This leverages an optimized inference stack for performance and keeps all sensitive data within our own cloud environment.

### Challenge 4: Cloud-Native CI/CD and Monitoring
**Problem:** Ensuring reliable deployments and system health in production.
**Solution:** Use Google Cloud Build for CI/CD and Google Cloud Operations for monitoring, alerting, and dashboards.

    ```


## üß™ Running Tests

- **Go Backend Tests:**
    ```bash
    cd services/backend-service
    go test ./...
    ```
- **Python AI/ML Service Tests:**
    ```bash
    cd services/ai-service
    pytest
    ```
- **Frontend Tests:**
    ```bash
    cd services/frontend
    ng test
    ```


MedLama is built with strict test-driven development (TDD) principles:

- **Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are required at every major phase.**
- **Test gates:** No phase is considered complete until all new features pass their respective tests.
- **Performance and accuracy:** AI/ML components are validated with benchmarks and truthfulness checks to ensure reliable medical reasoning.
- **Continuous integration:** Automated test runners (Go, Pytest, Karma/Jest, Cypress) are used before every major commit and deployment.

### Recommended Test Plan

#### System-Wide (End-to-End)
- User can register, login, and access protected chat
- Real-time chat works between multiple users
- AI/ML service returns plausible medical answers for sample prompts
- Conversation history is stored and retrievable from MongoDB
- Authenticated API calls are enforced (JWT required)
- Error handling for invalid tokens, missing data, and service downtime

#### Go Backend Service
- Unit: API endpoints, auth logic, DB ops, Pub/Sub
- Integration: register ‚Üí login ‚Üí chat ‚Üí store/retrieve conversation, WebSocket

#### Python AI/ML Service
- Unit: agent logic, API endpoints, model inference, session/state
- Integration: backend-to-AI/ML message flow, DB ops
- Performance/accuracy: benchmark response time, validate medical plausibility

#### Frontend (Next.js/Angular)
- Unit: components, services, state management
- Integration: API calls, route protection, real-time updates
- E2E: full user journey (register ‚Üí login ‚Üí chat ‚Üí view history)

#### Database (MongoDB)
- CRUD operations, data integrity, indexes

#### Authentication & Security
- Registration/login, JWT, protected routes, token storage, error handling

#### Real-Time Features
- WebSocket connection, auth enforcement, notification delivery

#### Test Gates
- All new features must pass unit, integration, and E2E tests before marking as complete
- No mocks/fakes for business logic‚Äîalways use real handlers and endpoints

**How to Run All Tests Locally:**
- Backend: `go test ./...`
- AI/ML: `pytest`
- Frontend: `npm test` or `ng test`
- E2E: `cypress run` (after starting all services with Docker Compose)

This approach ensures that every part of the system is robust, scalable, and ready for real-world healthcare use.
