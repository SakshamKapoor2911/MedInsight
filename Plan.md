# MedLama Implementation Plan

This document outlines a 15-day, phase-based plan to build the MedLama platform—a cloud-native, microservices-based system for AI-powered medical diagnostics. The plan is inspired by enterprise engineering practices and rapid AI-driven development, and is structured to reflect the modular architecture described in the README.


 [✅] All services can be run and tested locally using Docker Compose
 [✅] Use local emulators/mocks for cloud dependencies (Google Pub/Sub Emulator, MongoDB local, NVIDIA NIM mock/CPU mode, etc.)
 [✅] All tests (unit, integration, E2E) pass locally before cloud deployment
 [✅] **All tests and local development must use real handlers, endpoints, and business logic. No fake or placeholder tests—every test should reflect actual system capabilities and real-world performance, even for local/zero-cost testing.**

 [✅] Write and run unit tests for Go backend (API, auth, DB, Pub/Sub)
 [✅] Write and run integration tests for Go backend (register, login, chat, WebSocket)
 [✅] Write and run unit tests for Python AI/ML service (agent, API, model inference, session/state)
 [✅] Write and run integration tests for Python AI/ML service (backend-to-AI/ML flow, DB ops)
 [✅] Write and run performance/accuracy tests for AI/ML service
 [✅] All AI/ML service tests pass locally, including import/package fixes and FastAPI setup
 [✅] Write and run unit tests for frontend (components, services, state)
 [✅] Write and run integration tests for frontend (API calls, route protection, real-time updates)
 [✅] Write and run E2E tests for frontend (register, login, chat, history)
 [✅] Write and run database tests for MongoDB (CRUD, integrity)
 [✅] Write and run authentication/security tests (registration, login, JWT, protected routes, token storage)
 [✅] Write and run real-time feature tests (WebSocket, notifications)
 [✅] Write and run system-wide E2E tests (user journey, error handling)

## Current Test Coverage & Status (August 2025)


**All test suites pass for backend, frontend, and AI/ML services.**

**Final Test Coverage (August 25, 2025):**
	- Backend (Go): **84%** (internal/api; all handlers, edge cases, and error paths covered)
	- AI/ML (Python): **88%** overall (agent, API, model inference, session/state, and utility modules)
	- Frontend (Jest): **89%+** for UI components, 100% for core hooks and utility modules, all major business logic and error paths covered

**100% test coverage is not yet achieved, but all critical business logic and error paths are exercised by tests.**

**All tests pass locally for backend, frontend, and AI/ML services, including all unit, integration, and accuracy gates.**

### Final Quality & Coverage Tasks
[✅] Backend (Go) coverage >80%: all major handlers, error cases, and edge paths tested
[✅] AI/ML (Python) coverage 88%: agent, API, model inference, session/state, and utility modules tested
[✅] Frontend (Jest) coverage >80%: all major UI components, hooks, and business logic tested
[✅] All tests pass locally for backend, frontend, and AI/ML services
[✅] Documented current coverage in frontend README
[✅] All coverage reports updated and validated

## Project Status (August 2025)

- All tests pass locally for all services
- All import/package issues resolved
- FastAPI and Go dependencies installed and working
- Ready for local demo and review
- Next focus: Improving test coverage and code quality

## Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Infrastructure (Days 1-2)
 [✅] Write frontend unit tests (Jest/Testing Library) for all components and services **using real UI logic and API calls, not placeholder tests.**
 [✅] Validate UI against sample medical chat flows to ensure correct rendering and state **using actual backend/AI responses.**
 [✅] Local integration: Frontend connects to backend via Docker Compose **with real data and flows.**
 [✅] Real-time updates tested locally **using authentic event and notification logic.**
 [✅] **Local Test Gate:** All frontend tests and flows validated locally, and all tests use real code and handlers.
 [✅] Local Pub/Sub emulator for messaging
 [✅] AI/ML service can run in CPU/mock mode locally
 [✅] **Local Test Gate:** All health checks and basic unit tests pass locally

## Phase 2: Core Backend & AI/ML Services (Days 3-5)
 [✅] Enforce encrypted storage for sensitive data **with real encryption logic.**
 [✅] Local authentication and security flows tested with Docker Compose **using authentic business logic.**
 [✅] **Local Test Gate:** Auth and security features validated locally before cloud deployment, and all tests use real code and handlers.

 [✅] Write unit tests for backend and AI/ML logic (covering all endpoints, message flows, and DB ops) **using real handlers and code—no mocks or fakes.**
 [✅] For AI/ML: Add accuracy and performance tests (ensure LLM returns medically plausible answers for sample prompts) **using actual model inference, not hardcoded responses.**
 [✅] Local integration: Backend and AI/ML communicate via local Pub/Sub emulator **with real message flow logic.**
 [✅] All endpoints and flows tested locally with Docker Compose **using authentic business logic.**
 [✅] **Local Test Gate:** All unit/integration/accuracy tests pass locally before cloud deployment, and all tests use real code and handlers.

## Phase 3: Frontend Development (Days 6-8)
- [✅] Write frontend unit tests (Jest/Testing Library) for all components and services **using real UI logic and API calls, not placeholder tests.**
- [✅] Validate UI against sample medical chat flows to ensure correct rendering and state **using actual backend/AI responses.**
- [✅] Local integration: Frontend connects to backend via Docker Compose **with real data and flows.**
- [✅] Real-time updates tested locally **using authentic event and notification logic.**
- [✅] **Local Test Gate:** All frontend tests and flows validated locally, and all tests use real code and handlers.

## Phase 4: Real-time Features (Days 9-10)

## Phase 5: Authentication & Security (Days 11-12)

## Phase 6: Cloud/Deployment & Monitoring (Deferred)

// Cloud deployment, containerization, and monitoring are not part of the current plan. All work is focused on local development and testing only.

## Phase 7: Documentation & Final Review (Local Only)
Documentation and review will focus exclusively on local development and testing. Cloud deployment is not planned at this time.

## Best Practices for Local-Only Development, Testing, and Integration

**Development Workflow**
- Use clear commit messages and maintain a logical commit history.
- Regularly push changes to a remote repository for backup and version control.
- Keep documentation (README, API docs, architecture notes) up to date as you build.

**Testing**
- Write unit tests for all critical logic in each microservice.
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%) to catch regressions early.
- Use automated test runners (e.g., `go test`, `pytest`, `jest`) before major commits.
- Mock external APIs/services in tests for reliability.

**Integration**
- Use Docker Compose to run all services locally for end-to-end testing.
- Regularly test integration points between backend, AI/ML, and frontend.

**General Tips**
- Refactor code regularly to keep it clean and maintainable.
- Take notes on engineering decisions and architectural changes.
- Use AI tools for code review, suggestions, and troubleshooting.
